So here I will develop a hand tracking tool using Python. Every number of days seen will be converted into a number (1, 2, 3, -etc)

# 🤚 HandTrack ML

A machine learning based hand recognition system currently under active development. This project aims to accurately detect and track hand movements in real time using computer vision and deep learning techniques.
