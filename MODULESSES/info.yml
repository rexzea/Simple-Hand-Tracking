  name: Hand Tracking Without External Modules
  description: >
    Basic hand tracking implementation without using external libraries like OpenCV, Mediapipe, or NumPy.
    Results are less accurate and visually unappealing.
  goals:
    - Explore hand tracking using only core Python.
    - Avoid external dependencies for lightweight use.
  limitations:
    - Low accuracy.
    - Visually unappealing results.
  dependencies: []
