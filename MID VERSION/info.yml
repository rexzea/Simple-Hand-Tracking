version: 3.0
project:
  name: Complex Hand Tracking
  description: >
    A more advanced implementation of hand tracking with a complex code structure.
    High processing requirements make this version slower and heavier.
  goals:
    - Achieve detailed hand tracking with a complex architecture.
    - Experiment with advanced algorithms.
  limitations:
    - High computational cost.
    - Slower processing time.
  dependencies:
    - opencv-python
    - mediapipe
    - numpy
  status: completed
